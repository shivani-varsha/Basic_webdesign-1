# Basic_webdesign-1
Basic web-design or frontend using html and css
It is my first html and css contribution in github.
It has basic features like:
    * header and appropriate footer.
    * Create an account: This includes a appropriate frontend side only.
    * image input with hover style.
Its like a basic framework of an e-commerce site.
